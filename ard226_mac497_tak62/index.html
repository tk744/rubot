<h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p> Almost everybody has used a rubik's cube puzzle before, whether they are picking
  up the cube for the first time, looking up the solution algorithms, or playing
  around with a different iteration. Many different kinds of rubik's puzzles have
  come out over the years, such as the Rubik's Cube Pyramid and the 2-by-2 cube
  Rubik's Cube. The most common of these puzzles is the original 3-by-3 Rubik's Cube.
  For our final project, we made a Rubik's Cube solver that can guide people how to solve their
  Rubik's Cube after they have been scrambled. </p>
<h2>High Level Design </h2>

<h2> Hardware </h2>
  <p> Our project was mostly implemented with software. Visuals on the TFT display
    show the user the state of the solving algorithm and what moves to execute.

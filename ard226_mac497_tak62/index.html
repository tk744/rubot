<h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p> Almost everybody has used a rubik's cube puzzle before, whether they are picking
  up the cube for the first time, looking up the solution algorithms, or playing
  around with a different iteration. Many different kinds of rubik's puzzles have
  come out over the years, such as the Rubik's Cube Pyramid and the 2-by-2 cube
  Rubik's Cube. The most common of these puzzles is the original 3-by-3 Rubik's Cube.
  For our final project, we made a Rubik's Cube solver that can guide people how to solve their
  Rubik's Cube after they have been scrambled. </p>
<h2>High Level Design </h2>
  <p> </p>
<h2> Hardware </h2>
  <p> Our project was mostly implemented with software. Visuals on the TFT display
    show the user the state of the solving algorithm and what moves to execute.

  <h3>Graphics</h3>
    <p> As they are going through the solution steps, the user is shown what number
      step they are on, as well as the next move they should do. In addition to this,
      we also wanted to give them a reference for what their cube should look like after each move.
      The graphic is made up of two images, each showing three sides of the cube.
      The locations of the faces on the images are based on how the cube appears
      when it is looked at from the orientation of the images.

    <p> The representation of each face includes two opposite edges and nine unsigned
      short color values named color0 through color8. These values determine what
      color a given square on a face is drawn. The color of the square in the 0
      position is color0 and the color of the square in the 8 position is coclor8.
      The following image shows how the positions of squares on a face are determined.
    </p>
    <img src="face_representation.JPG">
    <p> In order to color a face, the coordinates of the face and the square position
      are used to determine where the color should go. Parallel lines of
       the given color are drawn across the square to give the appearance of a
       full square of color.
